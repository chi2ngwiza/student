                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>The escalating sophistication of cyberattacks targeting server infrastructure poses critical risks
                            to data integrity and operational continuity. This project addresses the urgent need for proactive
                            threat detection by proposing an AI-driven monitoring system integrating real-time behavioral
                            analysis and ensemble machine learning algorithms. The solution combines network traffic
                            pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and predictive threat scoring to identify vulnerabilities
                            before exploitation, leveraging open-source tools like ELK Stack and Suricata for cost-
                            effective scalability.</p>
                        <p>Methodologically, the system will be validated through simulated attack
                            scenarios (e.g., SQL injection, DDoS) and benchmarked against industry standards like
                            MITRE ATT&CK frameworks, with performance metrics including detection accuracy
                            (>90%), false positive rates (<10%), and response latency (<5 seconds). Expected outcomes
                            include a minimum 40% reduction in breach response time and a minimum 30% improvement
                            in threat prioritization efficiency, supported by comparative analysis of algorithmic
                            performance (e.g., Random Forest vs. XGBoost) and case studies from hybrid cloud
                            environments. </p>

                    <li><b>Preprocessing:</b> Cleans and transforms the collected data into a format suitable for machine
                        learning models.</li>

                <h2>AI Algorithms Used</h2>
                <p>The system utilizes ensemble machine learning algorithms to enhance threat detection accuracy:</p>

                <h3>Random Forest</h3>
                <p><b>Description:</b> An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision
                    trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or
                    mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.</p>
                <p><b>Use Case:</b> Identifying patterns in network traffic data and classifying potential threats based on
                    multiple decision paths.</p>

                <h3>XGBoost</h3>
                <p><b>Description:</b> A gradient boosting framework that sequentially combines weak learners (decision
                    trees) to create a strong learner. XGBoost is known for its scalability and ability to handle large
                    datasets with complex dependencies.</p>
                <p><b>Use Case:</b> Detecting anomalies in system logs and predicting the likelihood of future attacks based
                    on historical data.</p>

                <h3>Ensemble Approach</h3>
                <p><b>Combining Random Forest and XGBoost:</b> By combining these algorithms, the system leverages the
                    strengths of both, improving overall detection accuracy and reducing false positive rates. Random
                    Forest provides robust classification, while XGBoost enhances predictive capabilities.</p>
